If you got syntax error below when you are installing brython:

File "/Users/bohanli/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages/brython/__main__.py", line 133
    match args_1:

That is because your python version < 3.10 and it cant support match. 

This main.py has been already rewritten by python < 3.10

If you dont want to update your python, you can just replace the main.py under your brython folder with this main.py.
